Welcome to ArcDOS, the Arc Disk Operating System!

ArcDOS is an educational operating system for the Nintendo DS. Above all, it is
simple, designed with clarity of code in mind. It provides a simple command
line interface for loading and executing files, and that's about it.

ArcDOS is a low-level component of ArcOS, a full-featured operating system in
the same vein. As of yet ArcOS has not been developed.
