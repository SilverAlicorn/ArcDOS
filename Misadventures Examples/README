These are small demos showing off different functionality of the Nintendo DS.

tilefont.nds shows a simple way to get text onto the NDS screen. It is naive
but somewhat useful for early debugging.

peekreg.nds is a small program build on tilefont.nds that outputs a register
or a word in memory as a binary string on the top screen. It was originally
written to make sure code dealing with the stack pointer was functioning
correctly.

smartprint.nds is a demo showing off a more sophisticated print function. It
can print a string of text to either screen. If the string is longer than will
fit on the screen, it keeps deleting lines off the top until the last page of
the string is showing. Meant to be a baseline for all later text output needs.

These files can be assembled via the following invocation:

$ arm-eabi-as -o arm9.elf [source].s
$ arm-eabi-as -o arm7.elf default_arm7.s
$ arm-eabi-objcopy -O binary arm9.elf arm9.bin
$ arm-eabi-objcopy -O binary arm7.elf arm7.bin
$ ndstool -c [output].nds -9 arm9.bin -7 arm7.bin

You will need DevKitPro to assemble these demos.
